        *glade* is a path to an XML file defining widgets in libglade format.

        *builder* is a path to an XML file defining widgets in GtkBuilder
        format. It can also be a :class:`gtk.Builder` instance which already
        contains widgets. This is useful for internationalisation or if you
        want to break one XML file up into multiple views. Do not use that
        variant with class attributes, or all instances of this view will share
        one set of widgets.

        *top* is a string or a list of strings containing the names of our top
        level widgets. When using libglade only their children are loaded.
        This does NOT work with *builder*, each instance will create every
        window in the file.

        *parent* is used to call :meth:`set_parent_view`.

        The last two only work if *glade* or *builder* are used, not if you
        intend to create widgets later from code.

        .. deprecated:: 1.99.1

           class :class:`ManualView` and its child :class:`BuilderView`.

Conclusions
===========
The author does hope that this tutorial will be useful to help those
who are unsettled about whether |pygtkmvc| can fit their needs or not.

Even if very simple, from this tutorial should result clear to the
reader that both the MVC and Observer patterns can strongly improve
the quality of middle and big size |gui| applications, especially if
combined with the use of glade-based views.

|pygtkmvc| has been extensively used to produce a few large |obs|
applications based on |python| and |pygtk|. In this scenario, many
design choices that led to |pygtkmvc| had been determined from
practical needs, and this made easiness and transparency the most
appreciated quality of the framework.
